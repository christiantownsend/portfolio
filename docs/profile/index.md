Christian is an NYC-based multidisciplinary designer working with [The Collected Works](https://thecollectedworks.com/)

He's a collector of hobbies— outside of work you may find him building keyboards, doodling in his sketchbook, coding some shit, cooking, or most recently shredding it in guitar hero. When designing, he particularly enjoys building tools to make his life easier and spending time getting the <span class="nowrap">details right.</span>

He’s currently available for freelance projects, for clients in the areas of music, culture, or technology.
