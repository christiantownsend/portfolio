year: "2019"
description: Panoform is an online tool meant to allow people of all ages to
  produce “VR” content using only paper, drawing utensils, and a mobile device.
  Over the summer of 2019, working under a professor of mine, I entirely
  designed and developed the app and made it available to the public.
