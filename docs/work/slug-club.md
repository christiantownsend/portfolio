title: Slug Club Kombucha
year: "2021"
order: 1
description: Slug Club is an elevated kombucha (literally!), created with
  ​​Patagonian sourced ingredients, brewed and distributed in Argentina. Our
  design studio was approached to create a complete branding and packaging
  suite. Although kombucha is a wildly popular beverage here in the States, it’s
  still bubbling up in South America. The rebrand helps to market Slug Club in a
  less disruptive beverage market with a flexible custom wordmark that feels
  both approachable and too cool for school. The procession of thought is
  continued with our color palette and typography paired with the original Slug
  Club illustration, a piece of their original brand that we just loved too much
  to see go. The end result was a tasty and intelligent system leading the way
  to a bright, fresh new cold one to crack at your next gathering.
